# PyQt6 Final Project - Unit Converter + Simple Calculator

## Project Overview

This project is a desktop application built with Python and PyQt6. It combines two tools: a **Unit Converter** and a **Basic Calculator**. Users can perform metric-to-imperial conversions and basic arithmetic operations within an intuitive graphical interface.

## Features

- Main window with navigation buttons and menu bar
- Unit Converter:
  - Supports conversions (e.g., meters ↔ feet, Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
  - User-friendly interface with dropdowns and result display
- Simple Calculator:
  - Perform +, -, *, / operations on two inputs
  - Real-time validation and result feedback
- Keyboard shortcuts and menu integration
- Input validation and error handling dialogs
